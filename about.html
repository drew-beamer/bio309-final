                If you have seen the Jurassic Park films, you might be concerned to hear that scientists want to bring
                back extinct species. However, the goal of de-extinction work is not to create a theme park for
                dinosaurs, but rather to bring back biodiversity through studying recently extinct species' genomes.
                De-extinction is a subfield of genomics which focuses on reintroducing alleles and/or genomes of extinct
                species to the biosphere, or, most ambitiously, rebuilding the entire genome with the goal of bringing a
                species back to life.

                While this might sound like scientific fantasy, the field is slowly growing and
                gaining more traction as a viable counter to the ongoing loss of biodiversity brought about by human
                activity (Jaureguiberry CITATION). Some scientists predict that we are entering a sixth mass extinction
                event which could threaten life as we know it (Barnosky CITATION, Ceballos CITATION). In order to avert
                this catastrophe, innovative research such as de-extinction work will become more and more necessary.
                This may not always look like bringing a Tyrannosaurus rex back to life; more commonly, the goal of
                de-extinction work will be to reintroduce certain lost alleles into populations, increasing biodiversity
                more incrementally. However, the field does also include companies seeking to bring species back to life
                for commercial purposes, indicating that the field has many possible directions for the future.
