            <h1>ethics</h1>
            <p>
                One obvious ethical concern associated with studying de-extinction is the following: Shouldn't we be
                focusing resources towards living people and species who are at risk or suffering? This concern is
                certainly valid, and de-extinction research is by no means the solution to all environmental problems.
                Resources should certainly be devoted towards other pursuits of environmental justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                If researchers do succeed in bringing species back to life, we will need to find places for them to
                live. Reintroducing genomes to the wild comes with an inherent risk of disturbing wildlife, but we must
                also consider the human consequences of this relocation. With global populations constantly growing,
                work will be necessary to prevent de-extinction land relocations from infringing on indigenous lands or
                exploiting marginalized communities - especially those who did not support or were not aware of
                de-extinction work in the first place. If species are reintroduced into an ecosystem people depend on and
                unanticipated consequences arise, de-extinction will have disproportionately affected those living in this
                community, with little theoretical consequence (unless regulation is put in place) for researchers and funders. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from this, there are valid concerns about whether bringing extinct species back to life might
                upset the balance of the ecosystem rather than improve its biodiversity. It may even become valid to
                worry about a Jurassic Park-like situation in which de-extinction brings back megafauna like mammoths or
                dinosaurs which get out of control and become a danger to humans. However, remember that de-extinction
                proceeds slowly, and the likely first steps are the reintroduction of single alleles or genes.
                Researchers will certainly have to take precautions and consider the potential implications for the
                environment, but slow and methodical progress should include plenty of hesitancy and safety protocols.
