            <h2>sequencing extinct genomes</h2>
            <p>
                DNA degrades over time, in part due to a process called cytosine deamination. This process occurs when a
                cytosine undergoes hydrolysis, and is converted to a uracil. If left unchecked, this creates G to A and
                C to T mutations (Dabney CITATION) in the resulting reads. As such, cytosine deamination is a major
                inhibitor to obtaining high-quality genomes for extinct species, and processes need to be in place to
                address its effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paleogenomics comprises a set of techniques for sequencing ancient genomes through the careful
                extraction of preserved DNA samples. In contrast to modern genome sequencing from live samples,
                paleogenomic research must take abundant precautions in order to avoid damaging samples. The risk of
                losing a sample is far greater, as there is only a finite (and usually miniscule) amount of DNA that is
                preserved well enough to be studied. Samples usually come from fossils or remains that have been
                well-preserved by their environment. For example, one group of researchers located preserved mammoth
                bone samples and found a tooth with around 80% mammoth DNA content (Palkopoulou CITATION). This allowed
                the researchers to use careful sequencing to extract the genome of the specimen without damaging the
                DNA.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more recently extinct species, well-preserved specimens may exist, enabling higher-quality
                sequencing without additional paleogenomic steps. One example is the Tasmanian Tiger: a recent study
                seeking to assemble the Tasmanian Tigerâ€™s genome used samples from a 108 year old ethanol-preserved
                specimen (Feigin CITATION). This study found no evidence of cytosine deamination, which they credit to
                the method of preservation and the relatively young age of the sample.

            <h2>applications of CRISPR</h2>
            <p>
                CRISPR-Cas9 is an endonuclease system from bacteria that defends against bacteriophages. However, recent
                research has revealed that the CRISPR system can be used by researchers to artificially modify DNA in
                live cells with high accuracy (Jinek CITATION). The implications of this discovery for biological
                research are immense; for de-extinction work, this means that reintroducing lost alleles to living
                organisms is a viable way to increase biodiversity. CRISPR would also be a valuable tool in the
                potential reconstruction of extinct genomes. One company called Colossal is currently working to use
                CRISPR to stitch together DNA sequences from extinct organisms to construct a full genome (Colossal
                CITATION). They then plan to create artificial embryos of these species to rebirth extinct lineages.
